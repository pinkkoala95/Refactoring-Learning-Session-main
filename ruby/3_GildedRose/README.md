# Gilded Rose

Taken from [Emily Bache](github.com/emilybache), the idea is to refactor the code so that you can add a new item. 

Normally you have to write your own tests, but here I've stolen tests from [https://github.com/nwjsmith/practice/tree/master/004-gilded-rose] where they use [Approval Testing](https://github.com/kytrinyx/approvals) to generate some tests to quickly refactor against.

Get the tests running with `make test`.
