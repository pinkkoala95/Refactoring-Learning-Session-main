# Always Green Refactoring

> Exercises to practice refactoring without breaking tests.  

Run the tests with `make test` from the directory of the exercise you're trying. They will run until a test fails. When they do **undo until the tests were last passing.** This should be only a single change.

Can you refactor while making sure the tests always pass?

- GuidedExercise: A series of isolated exercises to learn IDE refactorings. **Recommended**.
- Tennis: A classic refactoring kata.
- GuildedRose: A very tricky refactoring task. This will be a **challenge**.

Each exercise is available in both JS and Ruby.

Tennis and Gilded Rose are taken from [Emily Bache](github.com/emilybache).
