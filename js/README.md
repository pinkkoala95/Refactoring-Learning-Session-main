Each exercise has been run using node 16. If you are using an earlier version of node, you may be able to lower the version of jest.

To run the exercise, `cd` into the exercise and run `make test` (or `npm install` and `npm test` on Windows).

If the tests fail at any point, undo until the tests pass again.
